# Organic-Compounds-Nomenclature-and-Structuralisation
Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and structure of elements and compounds. A branch of chemistry known as organic chemistry deals with the study of millions of carbon containing compounds. Using our knowledge of computer coding and organic chemistry we have endeavoured to make a project useful in the real life. This project is about an integral part of Organic Chemistry that is IUPAC Nomenclature and Structuralisation of organic compounds. The purpose of the IUPAC system of nomenclature is to establish an international standard of naming compounds to facilitate communication. The goal of the system is to give each structure a unique and unambiguous nme, and to correlate each name with a unique and unambiguous structure.
The main initiative was to research about the diverse kinds of organic compounds and to create a program for getting their formulae and structures. It helps us to determine the:-

1) Molecular formula of the compound (contracted form) in a specific carbon range.
2) Condensed Structure
3) Members of their homologous series
4) Display the functional group / type of compound

There is a practical application of the extended form of this program (requiring advanced knowledge of both computer science and chemistry) in chemistsâ€™ laboratories as it reduces friction and makes their work easier in obtaining complex formulas as well as structures. We have used translate() and maketrans() methods for printing the subscripts and also Regex Module for
extracting number of atoms from the formula. Our endeavour in this project has been to cover all important functional groups in organic chemistry, as it is very difficult to encompass 
each and every aspect of this diverse branch of chemistry.
